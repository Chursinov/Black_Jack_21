# Black_Jack_21
Tkinter minigame from TinyTower: Vegas

### Short Description
I've made a small copy of [NimbleBit](https://nimblebit.com/) minigame, called [Tiny Tower Vegas](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/tiny-tower-vegas/id871899103). 
There is a special floor in the casino category, where players can play Blackjack. 
### Steps
* First, I made [console version](https://github.com/Chursinov/Black_Jack_21/blob/master/Blackjack%20(Console).py) of this game, using some algorithms from github.
* Then I tried to connect the console and tkinter GUI, starting with just 3 buttons.
* After few fails i made GUI window from scratch, with 3 labels, and 2 buttons (Hit/Stand)
* Some OOP knowledge, and i did it in one Class, with __init__ and pair of methods
* In GitHub I found [Python code](https://github.com/PrateekJain14/Blackjack-Game), with cards, as *Labels* in *Frame*.
* I combined that code with my *GUI*, and added Tiny Tower textures for cards, background, and buttons.

**This is BETA code, new updates coming soon**
### Plans
* Add animations
* Fix sizes
* Fix button and remove white outline
* Add scores, money, and *chips*
* Fix *Status messages", and make them like in TinyTower:Vegas
* Add custom themes for buttons/background, like in TinyTower:Vegas
